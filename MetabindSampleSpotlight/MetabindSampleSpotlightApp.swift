/// The app entry point. Demonstrates the two things every Metabind app needs:
///
/// 1. **Create a ``MetabindClient``** with your API credentials.
/// 2. **Inject it into the SwiftUI environment** with `.environment(client)` so that
///    ``MetabindView`` instances anywhere in the hierarchy can fetch and render content.
///
/// This sample also shows how to pair Metabind content with local push notifications
/// and deep-link routing — a common pattern for promotional campaigns.

    // `MetabindClient` is an `@Observable` class, so we store it with `@State`
    // to give it a stable identity across view updates.
    //
    // To get your own credentials:
    //   1. Sign up free at metabind.ai/signup
    //   2. Create an org and project during onboarding
    //   3. Go to Settings (gear icon) → General → SDK section for your org/project IDs
    //   4. Go to Settings → API Keys → tap "+" to generate an API key (shown once — copy it)
    //
    // The url and ws endpoints are the same for all projects.
